This is the python script for getting external ip of network.



#You can specify a Python version for pip to use:
#pip3.4 install requests

#Python 3.4 has pip support built-in, so you can also use:
#python3.4 -m pip install

#If you're running Ubuntu (or probably Debian as well), you'll need to install the system pip3 separately:
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

#This will install the pip3 executable, so you can use it, as well as the earlier mentioned python3.4 -m pip:
pip3 install requests
